          <p>
            Reverse logistics refers to the process of returning goods from end users back to manufacturers 
            or retailers. This could be due to product returns, defects, end-of-life disposal, or recycling.

            proper disposal, Urbandot Couriers and Cargo ensures an efficient and hassle-free process.
