            “My professional journey began in 2009, driven by a deep curiosity
            and an unwavering belief in the transformative power of technology.
            Over the years, I navigated diverse industries, growing from
            hands-on roles to strategic leadership positions—each step
            reinforcing my passion for building solutions that move people and
            businesses forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2013, I took my first leap into entrepreneurship by founding an
            IT services company. Though that chapter was short-lived, it became
            one of the most defining experiences of my life. It taught me that
            true innovation comes not just from success, but from the courage
            to try, to learn, and to evolve.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>UrbanDot</strong> was born from that evolution—a vision
            shaped by resilience, refined by experience, and fueled by the
            belief that technology should not only solve problems, but spark
            possibilities. Today, we stand for more than services—we stand for
            impact, for forward-thinking, and for a future we can create
            together.”
