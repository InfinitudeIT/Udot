              My journey began in 2009, working tirelessly across industries, rising from entry-level
              roles to leadership positions. In 2013, I took a bold step into entrepreneurship with an
              IT services company. Though it closed in 2014, it became my greatest lesson and fueled
              my drive to succeed.
